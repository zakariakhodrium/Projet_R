\title{Draw a Grid with State and Indications}
\usage{
draw_grid(grid_state, gridSize, indications)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid_state}{A matrix representing the state of the grid. Each element 
represents a cell in the grid, with values:
  - 0: Empty cell
  - 1: Filled cell
  - 2: Cell with diagonal lines}

\item{gridSize}{The size of the grid (number of rows/columns).}

\item{indications}{A list containing horizontal and vertical indications for 
the grid. The list should have two elements:
  - horizontal: A character vector containing indications for each row.
  - vertical: A matrix containing indications for each column.}
}
\description{
This function draws a grid with specified grid state and indications.
}
\details{
The grid is drawn using base R plotting functions. Empty cells are 
represented by white rectangles, filled cells by black rectangles, and cells 
with diagonal lines by red diagonal lines. The horizontal and vertical 
indications are placed at the margins of the grid.
}
\examples{
# Define grid state and indications
grid_state <- matrix(c(0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0), nrow = 3)
indications <- list(horizontal = c("A", "B", "C"), 
                    vertical = matrix(c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"), nrow = 3))
# Draw the grid
draw_grid(grid_state, 3, indications)
